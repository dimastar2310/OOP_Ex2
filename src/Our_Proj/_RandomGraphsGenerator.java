     * as said at DWG its should support 100,000 nodes graphs
     * for each node in average 20 kids for each the edges are randomize
     * becouse its directed we doing randomization for each node
     * will make randomization for evrytime elsly the random node will be
     * set to 0 and all other nodes should be set to infinity
     * by the weights we track we making dessisions
     * we extending Our_Proj._DirectedWeighedGraphAlgorithms we have everything there
     * will make boolean for first node and hes value is 0 all others is infinity
